## Planning for a food ordering app

To make any app first make that app design
Then decide components of that app

We are also using props for dynamic content

### Props

Prop is a short form of properties

at the end of the day props are normal argument to a function

`<RestaurentCard
          resName="BAPASITARAM"
          cuisine="Dabeli, Vadapav, Sandwich"
        />
       `
in the above code
resName="BAPASITARAM"
cuisine="Dabeli, Vadapav, Sandwich" are known as props.

in react world
we call this as passing properties to an component
