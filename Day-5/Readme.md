### There two types of export and imports and those are named and default

- Default Export/Import

export default Component;
import Component from "path";

- Named Export/Import

export const Component;

# React Hooks

It is a normal js function and it is prebuilt - written by facebook developers
it is a utility function

Two very important hooks

1. useState() - Superpowerful state Variables in React
2. useEffect()

whenever state variable updates react re-renders the components
